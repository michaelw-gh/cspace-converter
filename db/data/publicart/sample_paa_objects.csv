38899,"Denver International Airport, Arts & Venues Denver: Public Art Program","""Cow"" is a 32-foot cast-fiberglass sculpture by Luis Jimenez. Jimenez' characteristic style references the grandeur of the Mexican muralists, the energy of the Southwest, and the bright colors he experienced in his youth in his father’s sign-making company. Jimenez’ vivid paint, unique treatment of surface, and method of exaggeration have influenced many young artists who are emerging in the galleries of Los Angeles and New York in the styles that are known as Lo-brow and Urban Art. Luis was an American artist who never forgot his Mexican heritage.© 2010 Estate of Luis A.

38905,Arts & Venues Denver: Public Art Program,"The piece includes metal fabricated constructions and neon banding of the architecture.  The metal structures are positioned in and around the terraced entry way in such a way that it gives the viewer the illusion of active kinetic energy.  Each individual piece darts and swirls around the columns like that of whirling dust devils, coaxing the viewer to follow and chase each piece.  The character of these constructions can have many origins.  They may suggest implements for mechanical measure, relate to organic plant forms, or even some kind of ceremonial scepter.  With the understanding that this building will have many uses and have diverse clientele: the intention is to tantalize each convention goer to assert each of his or her own experience and relationship that responds to the sculptural forms.<br/>The piece was originally installed in 1991 and reinstalled in 2004.",sculpture (visual work),Tail Spin,generic,neon; metal,2004,commission,50,height,feet,Erick Johnson,artist,person,DOCA,

38923,Arts & Venues Denver: Public Art Program,"Forgotten Landscape is a permanent video installation designed specifically for the new Hyatt Denver Convention Center Hotel in downtown Denver. The installation consists of a custom panoramic nine-video flat screen configuration built into the Hotel architecture displaying High Definition video content.<br/>The thirty-seven minute film loop displayed on the video screens explores the spectrum of moods and textures experienced in the obscure corners of the Colorado landscape - areas often overlooked, yet are quintessentially Colorado. A variety of environments - dry grassy plains, plowed fields, an abandoned farmhouse, mountain meadows, creeks and canyons - are associatively composed together to form a new dynamic and creative geography. Experimental techniques are used in the film to represent the act of seeing and recognizing the figurative world, as images emerge from- and dissolve into overexposed shots.",video art,Forgotten Landscape,generic,electronic image components,2006,commission,,height,,Shannon Kelly,artist,person,DOCA,
